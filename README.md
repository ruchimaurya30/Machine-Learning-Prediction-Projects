The House Price Prediction project involves building a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on various features like location, size, and amenities. 
The project starts with data cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. 
Various models, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, are trained and evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error module. 
The final model is fine-tuned and deployed to predict prices accurately, aiding stakeholders in making informed real estate decisions.
Clearly, SVM model is giving better accuracy as the mean absolute error is the least among all the other regressor models i.e. 0.18 approx.
